# Personal iTerm2 / PhpStorm / Sublime Text color schemes

Whenever possible I use a color scheme based on ["Panic Palette"](https://twitter.com/panic/status/558389225612005376) by Panic.

- ```Panic Palette iTerm2.itermcolors``` based on https://github.com/iest/Panic-Palette-Extras with some modifications
- ```Panic Palette PhpStorm.icls``` based on https://github.com/ryanolton/phpstorm-panic-palette and updated with some Laravel/Blade modifications
- ```Panic Palette Sublime Text.tmTheme``` from https://github.com/iest/Panic-Palette-Extras
